# FriendFinder

## Abstract

With the app "FriendFinder" you are able to send your position to any of your contacts by only clicking a few buttons.

First you send your position as a SMS to your contact. Your contact needs the app "FriendFinder" too, to encrypt the message. If your contact has the app and receives the SMS sent by your app, his FriendFinder will open automatically and shows a map. On this map he will see his own position as well as the location your app has sent. Now he knows exactly where you are at and gets offered the options to calculate a route to your position, call you or send his location back to you.

You also can attach a short text while sending the position so the receiver of your location gets to know the reason for your sending.

## Permissions

The app needs the permission to use GPS to get your position. It also needs the permission to capture incoming SMS to work automatically. There are some features that simplify the usage of the app, such as help buttons in the menu and the import option in the managament of contacts.

## Usage

This app could have use in practical examples like when you are somewhere in a foreign city and your friend wants to pick you up. You send him your location by the app and he can easily navigate to you. Another example is that your friend is at an event by one of his friends who you do not know. He sends you his location with a short text like "interesting event here, come around". Without further explanations of the location you can visit the event.
